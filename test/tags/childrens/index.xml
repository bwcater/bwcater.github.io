      <description>I am excited to share that I have a new children&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ndash; Looking For Friends In My Backyard.
Looking For Friends In My Backyard is about a day in the life of a little boy exploring his backyard! The illustrations are watercolor pieces that I did myself.

You can order your copy today on Amazon.com!
