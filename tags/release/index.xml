      <description>I am excited to say that soon you can purchase, and stream, a couple of new guitar instrumentals. Lend an ear and take the new tunes for a spin on your favorite service.
I know they are very different styles! What can I say? I love playing and experimenting.
I hope you enjoy them as much as I did making playing and recording them.

December 4 -- 1978 will be available.</description>

      <description>Recently, I shared this tune with a friend of mine in New Orleans. He told me it was a perfect song for the times.
Perhaps Tomorrow is a song I might give to my younger self given the chance. Life can be hard and doesn’t pull punches. One makes mistakes, but tomorrow is a new day! It’s a chance to heal, to move on, to go a new direction.</description>
