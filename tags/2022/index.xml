      <description>Merry Christmas &amp;amp; all the best to you and your family! It has been quite an interesting year.
While I have largely been silent here on the blog, and on social media, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy on a number of fronts. I plan to share more in the new year. For now enjoy your time with those around you.
Wayne
