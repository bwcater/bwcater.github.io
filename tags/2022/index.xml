      <description>Merry Christmas &amp;amp; all the best to you and your family! It has been quite an interesting year.
While I have largely been silent here on the blog, and on social media, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy on a number of fronts. I plan to share more in the new year. For now enjoy your time with those around you.

      <description>The last time I checked I had more than 40,000 frames stored that I had taken using my Nikon D70. I have been occasionally going through them and sharing them on my Facebook and Instagram accounts. As you can see below I really have a thing for landscapes! 😀 There are some other subjects in the mix too.

      <description>Sometimes we find that one thing that ignites our being and fuels our creativity. I was 16 when my mom gave me the gift that would be a direction setter for the rest of my life. It was a Ricoh KR-5 Super 35mm single lens reflex camera. I used it through high school snapping frames for the yearbook and newspaper. I would go on to learn how to process black and white Kodak film using D50 chemicals, which by the way, landed me a high school job at my small town&amp;rsquo;s local newspaper.</description>

      <description>The cold wind stirs and the sleeting rain pours just outside my window. I long for spring temperatures and more sunlight. Some prep work has been done around the house and yard in faith that the 2022 garden season will bear a fresh beautiful batch of vegetables. My wife and I enjoy our time together working in our garden.
Since I posted my &amp;lsquo;Something New, Something Old&amp;rsquo; post back in November 2021, I have been continuing on my trek learning Elixir, and functional programming.</description>
