      <description>I started working on this song earlier this week. Different guitars inspire different ideas and I found myself enjoying this one on the resonator guitar. I recorded this using my iPhone; I hope enjoy it! I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the future to record more than a demo of it.

      <description>This guitar instrumental was recorded at my home. The rhythm guitar used was a Taylor 110e and the lead guitar used was an Epiphone PR5E/N Nylon stringed guitar. I used a Fernandez bass for the bass track.
I dedicate this to my wife. I will continue to love you and cherish you until the last heartbeat&amp;hellip;
