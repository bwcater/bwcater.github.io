      <description>I started working on this song earlier this week. Different guitars inspire different ideas and I found myself enjoying this one on the resonator guitar. I recorded this using my iPhone; I hope you enjoy it! I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the future to record more than a demo of it.

      <description>This is a small test drive of a Gretsch 9220 Resonator guitar with all mahogany body. Though it has a mic pickup, I mic&amp;rsquo;d it with a Shure SM-57. I am no sound engineer, but I felt like this simple recording came out nicely.
I hope you enjoy this short demo.

      <description>Chasing Rainbows is an upbeat guitar instrumental recorded at home using a Guild mahogany guitar in front of a Shure 57 mic. I shot the photographs in Breckinridge County, Kentucky.

      <description>This guitar instrumental was recorded at my home. The rhythm guitar used was a Taylor 110e and the lead guitar used was an Epiphone PR5E/N Nylon stringed guitar. I used a Fernandez bass for the bass track.
I dedicate this to my wife. I will continue to love you and cherish you until the last heartbeat&amp;hellip;

      <description>Merry Christmas!!! I was scheduled to share the following arrangement this morning at church. I woke up with the sinus crud and won&amp;rsquo;t be there. This was recorded earlier in the week during a practice session.
I pray your Christmas is filled with the love of family and friends. Whether you have sweet memories from the past, or not, may there be time now to make new memories with those around you.</description>

      <description>I am excited to say that soon you can purchase, and stream, a couple of new guitar instrumentals. Lend an ear and take the new tunes for a spin on your favorite service.
I know they are very different styles! What can I say? I love playing and experimenting.
I hope you enjoy them as much as I did making playing and recording them.

December 4 -- 1978 will be available.</description>

      <description>This is a guitar instrumental demo recorded at home using a Gretsch Streamliner in Logic Pro X. This recording is comprised of 3 tracks: drums via the Logic Pro X drummer, a Fernandes bass track I played, and finally the Gretsch Streamliner. I hope you like it!!!

      <description>A slight chill eases into the evening air. Leaves drift sharing their color all around while evenings fill with the crackling of old wood in the fire-pit. This short acoustic guitar track was something I noodled today that made me think of Autumn. Lucas our Labrador makes his first music debut in the early seconds of the track. I hope you like. üòÄ

      <description>Sometimes it seems we are given more challenges in life than others. We often wonder why? Somedays I think we need to be encouraged to keep on keeping on.
¬†Don&amp;rsquo;t you give up!  Don&amp;rsquo;t surrender!  You&amp;rsquo;re a fighter, a strong contender!  You got this!  You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!!! 
I wrote this for my friend Matt who now lives in Indiana! You got this! You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!</description>

      <description>A while back I heard someone use the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with you‚Äù in a playful sense. Recorded at home without a lot of dazzle, here‚Äôs my take on that phrase.

      <description>Over the years in our home I made up silly songs about various subjects. One day a few years ago, I started calling my wife Martha Jane teasingly. The little rhyme ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;Martha Jane, dancin‚Äô in the pourin‚Äô rain&amp;rdquo; came into being.
This silly song makes me smile. I hope you enjoy it too!!!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to be slowing down much of the time so that I could enjoy the little things in life. Like so many of us, I find myself pulled in a number of directions trying to keep it all moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;d like to practice what I preach, but in honesty, the only slowing down I might do today would be to share this track!
This is a simple instrumental with a little vocal harmony near the end; I recorded it at home using Logic Pro X, a Focusrite 18i8, a tele custom, and a Shure SM58; I hope you like it.</description>

      <description>I wrote the first verse of this a couple of weeks back. I tinkered and toyed with it here and there as time allowed. Finally, this afternoon, I worked on it until it became what you hear in this video. I hope you like it.
