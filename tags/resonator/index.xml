      <description>Using a Gretsch resonator guitar for both the rhythm and lead parts, here is my take on Wayfaring Stranger. I hope you like it.

      <description>I started working on this song earlier this week. Different guitars inspire different ideas and I found myself enjoying this one on the resonator guitar. I recorded this using my iPhone; I hope you enjoy it! I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the future to record more than a demo of it.

      <description>This is a small test drive of a Gretsch 9220 Resonator guitar with all mahogany body. Though it has a mic pickup, I mic&amp;rsquo;d it with a Shure SM-57. I am no sound engineer, but I felt like this simple recording came out nicely.
I hope you enjoy this short demo.
