      <description>This is a guitar instrumental demo recorded at home using a Gretsch Streamliner in Logic Pro X. This recording is comprised of 3 tracks: drums via the Logic Pro X drummer, a Fernandes bass track I played, and finally the Gretsch Streamliner. I hope you like it!!!

      <description>A slight chill eases into the evening air. Leaves drift sharing their color all around while evenings fill with the crackling of old wood in the fire-pit. This short acoustic guitar track was something I noodled today that made me think of Autumn. Lucas our Labrador makes his first music debut in the early seconds of the track. I hope you like. üòÄ

      <description>This is a guitar demo using a 1978 Ibanez PF100 (shown in the photo) plugged into a Korg G3 processor. I had fun laying down the bass and guitar tracks. I hope you like!!!

      <description>Sometimes it seems we are given more challenges in life than others. We often wonder why? Somedays I think we need to be encouraged to keep on keeping on.
¬†Don&amp;rsquo;t you give up!  Don&amp;rsquo;t surrender!  You&amp;rsquo;re a fighter, a strong contender!  You got this!  You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!!! 
I wrote this for my friend Matt who now lives in Indiana! You got this! You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!</description>

      <description>A while back I heard someone use the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with you‚Äù in a playful sense. Recorded at home without a lot of dazzle, here‚Äôs my take on that phrase.

      <description>Over the years in our home I made up silly songs about various subjects. One day a few years ago, I started calling my wife Martha Jane teasingly. The little rhyme ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;Martha Jane, dancin‚Äô in the pourin‚Äô rain&amp;rdquo; came into being.
This silly song makes me smile. I hope you enjoy it too!!!

      <description>Recently, I shared this tune with a friend of mine in New Orleans. He told me it was a perfect song for the times.
Perhaps Tomorrow is a song I might give to my younger self given the chance. Life can be hard and doesn‚Äôt pull punches. One makes mistakes, but tomorrow is a new day! It‚Äôs a chance to heal, to move on, to go a new direction.</description>

      <title>Slowin&#39; Down</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to be slowing down much of the time so that I could enjoy the little things in life. Like so many of us, I find myself pulled in a number of directions trying to keep it all moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;d like to practice what I preach, but in honesty, the only slowing down I might do today would be to share this track!
This is a simple instrumental with a little vocal harmony near the end; I recorded it at home using Logic Pro X, a Focusrite 18i8, a tele custom, and a Shure SM58; I hope you like it.</description>
