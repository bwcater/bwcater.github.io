      <description>A slight chill eases into the evening air. Leaves drift sharing their color all around while evenings fill with the crackling of old wood in the fire-pit. This short acoustic guitar track was something I noodled today that made me think of Autumn. Lucas our Labrador makes his first music debut in the early seconds of the track. I hope you like. ðŸ˜€

      <description>This is a guitar demo using a 1978 Ibanez PF100 (shown in the photo) plugged into a Korg G3 processor. I had fun laying down the bass and guitar tracks. I hope you like!!!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to be slowing down much of the time so that I could enjoy the little things in life. Like so many of us, I find myself pulled in a number of directions trying to keep it all moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;d like to practice what I preach, but in honesty, the only slowing down I might do today would be to share this track!
This is a simple instrumental with a little vocal harmony near the end; I recorded it at home using Logic Pro X, a Focusrite 18i8, a tele custom, and a Shure SM58; I hope you like it.</description>
