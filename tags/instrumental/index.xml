      <title>Paradise Lost</title>

      <description>A few weeks ago, I laid down the synth sounds to this track using a Fishman TriplePlay Connect attached to a Stratocaster. This was really a lot of fun. I added the lead guitar track a couple of weeks later using one of the selections from a Fender Mustang LT-25. The cover pic was simply shot using an iPhone with the Classic Hipstamatic app with my own config for black and white frames.</description>

      <description>This is a little piece I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on; I think it sounds peaceful and balanced on the Martin 000-15SM, a mahogany acoustic guitar. I picked this up used at https://www.rumbleseatmusic.com in Nashville.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been tinkering with a slide and different tunings on this guitar. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll share some of that in future videos.

      <description>This guitar instrumental was recorded at my home. The rhythm guitar used was a Taylor 110e and the lead guitar used was an Epiphone PR5E/N Nylon stringed guitar. I used a Fernandez bass for the bass track.
I dedicate this to my wife. I will continue to love you and cherish you until the last heartbeat&amp;hellip;

      <description>I am excited to say that soon you can purchase, and stream, a couple of new guitar instrumentals. Lend an ear and take the new tunes for a spin on your favorite service.
I know they are very different styles! What can I say? I love playing and experimenting.
I hope you enjoy them as much as I did making playing and recording them.

December 4 -- 1978 will be available.</description>

      <description>This is a guitar instrumental demo recorded at home using a Gretsch Streamliner in Logic Pro X. This recording is comprised of 3 tracks: drums via the Logic Pro X drummer, a Fernandes bass track I played, and finally the Gretsch Streamliner. I hope you like it!!!

      <description>A slight chill eases into the evening air. Leaves drift sharing their color all around while evenings fill with the crackling of old wood in the fire-pit. This short acoustic guitar track was something I noodled today that made me think of Autumn. Lucas our Labrador makes his first music debut in the early seconds of the track. I hope you like. ðŸ˜€

      <description>This is a guitar demo using a 1978 Ibanez PF100 (shown in the photo) plugged into a Korg G3 processor. I had fun laying down the bass and guitar tracks. I hope you like!!!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to be slowing down much of the time so that I could enjoy the little things in life. Like so many of us, I find myself pulled in a number of directions trying to keep it all moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;d like to practice what I preach, but in honesty, the only slowing down I might do today would be to share this track!
This is a simple instrumental with a little vocal harmony near the end; I recorded it at home using Logic Pro X, a Focusrite 18i8, a tele custom, and a Shure SM58; I hope you like it.</description>
