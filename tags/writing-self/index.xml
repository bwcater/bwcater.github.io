      <description>While working to flesh out the content for the new site, I find myself hanging on little details. I really don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy writing and talking about myself. I find that I go into editorial mode and overwork the details of &amp;lsquo;what to keep / what to delete&amp;rsquo;.
There are so many little things I could tell you about myself. The little marketing voices start kicking in and they drown out the earthy realism of what could be captured and shared.</description>
