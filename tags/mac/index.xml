      <description>The cold wind stirs and the sleeting rain pours just outside my window. I long for spring temperatures and more sunlight. Some prep work has been done around the house and yard in faith that the 2022 garden season will bear a fresh beautiful batch of vegetables. My wife and I enjoy our time together working in our garden.
Since I posted my &amp;lsquo;Something New, Something Old&amp;rsquo;) post back in November 2021, I have been continuing on my trek learning Elixir, and functional programming.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little Midiman 1x1 Sport that I love using. It uses phantom power and is small enough to haul around if needed. I have other gear that I can use to replace it, but I wanted to keep using this device.
The Midiman 1x1 Sport does NOT work with Mac OS Catalina, or Big Sur without a 64 bit driver update. There is NO updated driver from the manufacturer.</description>
