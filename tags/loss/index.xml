      <description>Sadly this past March we said goodbye to a part of our family, Lucas. Lucas came into our lives a little over nine years ago. We knew he was getting older, but when he slowed down a good bit during his daily walks, we didn&amp;rsquo;t quite realize there was something more going on.
My wife took him for his regular nail clipping and the veterinarian noticed he wasn&amp;rsquo;t himself. She asked to do some scans and the resulting news rattled our world.</description>
