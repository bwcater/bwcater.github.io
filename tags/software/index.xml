      <description>In an era not so far away I once purchased and used expensive software to edit images and build web site animations. I am looking at you Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Flash. I bought updates over the years excited to get some new feature that promised to wow my customers and make my life easier and building output faster.
I was hooked until the subscription service model became the standard. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like buying use of something I would technically never own.</description>
