      <description>The watercolor above will be soon heading south, to South Louisiana, that is. It will be headed to the home of an old high school friend.
It was only a few years ago that my wife gave me a cheap set of watercolors in a little wooden box as a Christmas gift. I had no formal training. Like most things in my life I would grow into a style by expermentation and studying the works of others.</description>

      <description>The last time I checked I had more than 40,000 frames stored that I had taken using my Nikon D70. I have been occasionally going through them and sharing them on my Facebook and Instagram accounts. As you can see below I really have a thing for landscapes! ðŸ˜€ There are some other subjects in the mix too.

Above: Over The Hill, taken in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on a weekend trip with my wife.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we find that one thing that ignites our being and fuels our creativity. I was 16 when my mom gave me the gift that would be a direction setter for the rest of my life. It was a Ricoh KR-5 Super 35mm single lens reflex camera. I used it through high school snapping frames for the yearbook and newspaper. I would go on to learn how to process black and white Kodak film using D50 chemicals, which by the way, landed me a high school job at my small town&amp;rsquo;s local newspaper.</description>

I have been well known to doodle, cartoon, caricature, and sketch coworkers through the last few years. At one employer, it was a regular thing having new hires brought by my cubicle entry for me to take a photo of them and draw them later.ðŸ˜ƒ
I think some times we have jobs where it meets the need of earning a check, providing insurance coverage, and not much else. If we are blessed, we may find those positions where we feel good about what we are doing daily.</description>

      <title>The Empty Sketchbook</title>

      <description>Last Christmas (2020) my wife gave me a nice sketchbook. I was excited by it. I could imagine it filled with all kinds of interesting sketches, some watercolor ideas, and generally filled with cool art.
Here I am in late September 2021, and well, the sketchbook&amp;rsquo;s pages have remained free of pencil marks, watercolors, or ideas from yours truly.
Admittedly this year I have not cranked out as many new pieces of art as in the past few years.</description>
