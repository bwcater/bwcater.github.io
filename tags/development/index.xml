      <description>The cold wind stirs and the sleeting rain pours just outside my window. I long for spring temperatures and more sunlight. Some prep work has been done around the house and yard in faith that the 2022 garden season will bear a fresh beautiful batch of vegetables. My wife and I enjoy our time together working in our garden.
Since I posted my &amp;lsquo;Something New, Something Old&amp;rsquo; post back in November 2021, I have been continuing on my trek learning Elixir, and functional programming.</description>

      <description>Working with technology in my day job, I enjoy reading various sources and learning what others are doing with technologies they use in their day jobs and lives. Two sites that I frequent are Hacker News and Slashdot.org.
On Hacker News I have noticed links about a technology called Elixir. Candidly, I skipped over them because there are so many technologies available these days, and only so many hours a day!</description>
