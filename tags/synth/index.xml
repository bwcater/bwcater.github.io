      <description>A few weeks ago, I laid down the synth sounds to this track using a Fishman TriplePlay Connect attached to a Stratocaster. This was really a lot of fun. I added the lead guitar track a couple of weeks later using one of the selections from a Fender Mustang LT-25. The cover pic was simply shot using an iPhone with the Classic Hipstamatic app with my own config for black and white frames.</description>
