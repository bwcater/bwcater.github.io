      <description>Sitting here in my easy chair looking over the new Hugo based site, I was thinking about adding a page, or section, to show some of my photography. Over the years I have photographed brides &amp;amp; grooms, family portraits, product lines for companies, music recording sessions at Nashville studios for music artists, farm landscapes, and many other subjects!
