      <description>A slight chill eases into the evening air. Leaves drift sharing their color all around while evenings fill with the crackling of old wood in the fire-pit. This short acoustic guitar track was something I noodled today that made me think of Autumn. Lucas our Labrador makes his first music debut in the early seconds of the track. I hope you like. üòÄ

      <description>Sometimes it seems we are given more challenges in life than others. We often wonder why? Somedays I think we need to be encouraged to keep on keeping on.
¬†Don&amp;rsquo;t you give up!  Don&amp;rsquo;t surrender!  You&amp;rsquo;re a fighter, a strong contender!  You got this!  You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!!! 
I wrote this for my friend Matt who now lives in Indiana! You got this! You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!</description>

      <description>A while back I heard someone use the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with you‚Äù in a playful sense. Recorded at home without a lot of dazzle, here‚Äôs my take on that phrase.

      <description>Over the years in our home I made up silly songs about various subjects. One day a few years ago, I started calling my wife Martha Jane teasingly. The little rhyme ‚Äî &amp;ldquo;Martha Jane, dancin‚Äô in the pourin‚Äô rain&amp;rdquo; came into being.
This silly song makes me smile. I hope you enjoy it too!!!
