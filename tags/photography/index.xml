      <description>The last time I checked I had more than 40,000 frames stored that I had taken using my Nikon D70. I have been occasionally going through them and sharing them on my Facebook and Instagram accounts. As you can see below I really have a thing for landscapes! ðŸ˜€ There are some other subjects in the mix too.

      <description>Sometimes we find that one thing that ignites our being and fuels our creativity. I was 16 when my mom gave me the gift that would be a direction setter for the rest of my life. It was a Ricoh KR-5 Super 35mm single lens reflex camera. I used it through high school snapping frames for the yearbook and newspaper. I would go on to learn how to process black and white Kodak film using D50 chemicals, which by the way, landed me a high school job at my small town&amp;rsquo;s local newspaper.</description>
