      <description>I started working on this song earlier this week. Different guitars inspire different ideas and I found myself enjoying this one on the resonator guitar. I recorded this using my iPhone; I hope you enjoy it! I&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the future to record more than a demo of it.

      <description>Chasing Rainbows is an upbeat guitar instrumental recorded at home using a Guild mahogany guitar in front of a Shure 57 mic. I shot the photographs in Breckinridge County, Kentucky.

Perhaps Tomorrow is a song I might give to my younger self given the chance. Life can be hard and doesn’t pull punches. One makes mistakes, but tomorrow is a new day! It’s a chance to heal, to move on, to go a new direction.</description>
