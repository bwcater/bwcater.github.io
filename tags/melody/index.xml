      <description>This guitar instrumental was recorded at my home. The rhythm guitar used was a Taylor 110e and the lead guitar used was an Epiphone PR5E/N Nylon stringed guitar. I used a Fernandez bass for the bass track.
I dedicate this to my wife. I will continue to love you and cherish you until the last heartbeat&amp;hellip;

      <description>Merry Christmas!!! I was scheduled to share the following arrangement this morning at church. I woke up with the sinus crud and won&amp;rsquo;t be there. This was recorded earlier in the week during a practice session.
I pray your Christmas is filled with the love of family and friends. Whether you have sweet memories from the past, or not, may there be time now to make new memories with those around you.</description>
