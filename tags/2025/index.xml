      <description>Here we are in October already! 2025 has really flown by! Yeah, I am starting to sound like and old guy now, right? 😀
The Summer was busy working my day job, and after hours, converting an old shed into a greenhouse for my wife. It was definitely a labor of love. While it was hard work, I enjoyed it.</description>

      <description>Dear Reader, Happy New Year to you and your family! 2024 is gone now forever.
It seems as one grows older that the years pick up speed and that our days are truly but a vapor. Reading Psalm 39:5 (NKJV), Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my age is as nothing before You; Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor. Selah
Typically, for me, today is a day of reflection on past goals, and where I am in relation to those goals, both in the near term and in the long term.</description>
