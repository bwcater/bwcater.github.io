      <description>In an era not so far away I once purchased and used expensive software to edit images and build web site animations. I am looking at you Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Flash. I bought updates over the years excited to get some new feature that promised to wow my customers and make my life easier and building output faster.
I was hooked until the subscription service model became the standard. I didn&amp;rsquo;t like buying use of something I would technically never own.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it seems we are given more challenges in life than others. We often wonder why? Somedays I think we need to be encouraged to keep on keeping on.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t you give up!  Don&amp;rsquo;t surrender!  You&amp;rsquo;re a fighter, a strong contender!  You got this!  You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!!! 
I wrote this for my friend Matt who now lives in Indiana! You got this! You&amp;rsquo;re gonna overcome!</description>

      <description>A while back I heard someone use the phrase “I’m done with you” in a playful sense. Recorded at home without a lot of dazzle, here’s my take on that phrase.

      <description>Over the years in our home I made up silly songs about various subjects. One day a few years ago, I started calling my wife Martha Jane teasingly. The little rhyme — &amp;ldquo;Martha Jane, dancin’ in the pourin’ rain&amp;rdquo; came into being.
This silly song makes me smile. I hope you enjoy it too!!!
