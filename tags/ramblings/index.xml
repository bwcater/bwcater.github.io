      <description>The watercolor above will be soon heading south, to South Louisiana, that is. It will be headed to the home of an old high school friend.
It was only a few years ago that my wife gave me a cheap set of watercolors in a little wooden box as a Christmas gift. I had no formal training. Like most things in my life I would grow into a style by expermentation and studying the works of others.</description>
