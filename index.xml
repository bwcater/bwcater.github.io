      <description>Today as I added some art to the site, I realized that in 2016 I posted more art per month. I was surprised to see in the years that followed I posted less. While I have posted less in the last few years since, I&amp;rsquo;ve not given up the desire, nor the pencil, or brush!
When I walk the dog, or work in the garden, I stare at the trees, the land, the sky.</description>

      <description>While working to flesh out the content for the new site, I find myself hanging on little details. I really don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy writing and talking about myself. I find that I go into editorial mode and overwork the details of &amp;lsquo;what to keep / what to delete&amp;rsquo;.
There are so many little things I could tell you about myself. The little marketing voices start kicking in and they drown out the earthy realism of what could be captured and shared.</description>
