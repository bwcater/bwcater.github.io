      <description>Candidly, this page is a work in progress. Below is a really small subset of my watercolor work. The plan is to add more in the coming days and weeks.
At this time, if you care to view many more examples of my watercolor work, as well as my pencil work, be sure to visit my Instagram feed!
   The purpose of art is washing the dust of daily life off our souls.</description>

Recently my wife and I drove to Northwestern Kentucky to help our son-in-law and youngest daughter get unpacked and settled into their new home. Between some of the unboxing and furniture moving I captured these frames using my little iPhone (SE2 model). Though I think these frames are nice, I wish I had taken my Nikon D-70 to see what I could have captured with it.
&#34;
&#34;
Over the span of a few days we experienced heavy afternoon rains, some large sized hail, and saw some beautiful clouds driven by fervent winds.</description>

      <description>Over the years in our home I made up silly songs about various subjects. One day a few years ago, I started calling my wife Martha Jane teasingly. The little rhyme â€” &amp;ldquo;Martha Jane, dancinâ€™ in the pourinâ€™ rain&amp;rdquo; came into being.
This silly song makes me smile. I hope you enjoy it too!!!

      <description>Merry Christmas &amp;amp; all the best to you and your family! It has been quite an interesting year.
While I have largely been silent here on the blog, and on social media, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy on a number of fronts. I plan to share more in the new year. For now enjoy your time with those around you.

      <description>The last time I checked I had more than 40,000 frames stored that I had taken using my Nikon D70. I have been occasionally going through them and sharing them on my Facebook and Instagram accounts. As you can see below I really have a thing for landscapes! ðŸ˜€ There are some other subjects in the mix too.

      <description>Sometimes we find that one thing that ignites our being and fuels our creativity. I was 16 when my mom gave me the gift that would be a direction setter for the rest of my life. It was a Ricoh KR-5 Super 35mm single lens reflex camera. I used it through high school snapping frames for the yearbook and newspaper. I would go on to learn how to process black and white Kodak film using D50 chemicals, which by the way, landed me a high school job at my small town&amp;rsquo;s local newspaper.</description>

      <description>The cold wind stirs and the sleeting rain pours just outside my window. I long for spring temperatures and more sunlight. Some prep work has been done around the house and yard in faith that the 2022 garden season will bear a fresh beautiful batch of vegetables. My wife and I enjoy our time together working in our garden.
Since I posted my &amp;lsquo;Something New, Something Old&amp;rsquo; post back in November 2021, I have been continuing on my trek learning Elixir, and functional programming.</description>

      <description>As we slow down to celebrate Christmas with our families, friends, and coworkers, I want to say thank you to all of you who purchased a song or two, streamed my music, or purchased a copy of my children&amp;rsquo;s book this year!
I pray your Christmas is filled with peace, joy, and love, and that the new year will bring you hope and anticipation of new friendships, new directions, and a rekindled zest for life!</description>

      <description>Working with technology in my day job, I enjoy reading various sources and learning what others are doing with technologies they use in their day jobs and lives. Two sites that I frequent are Hacker News and Slashdot.org.
On Hacker News I have noticed links about a technology called Elixir. Candidly, I skipped over them because there are so many technologies available these days, and only so many hours a day!</description>

I have been well known to doodle, cartoon, caricature, and sketch coworkers through the last few years. At one employer, it was a regular thing having new hires brought by my cubicle entry for me to take a photo of them and draw them later.ðŸ˜ƒ
I think some times we have jobs where it meets the need of earning a check, providing insurance coverage, and not much else. If we are blessed, we may find those positions where we feel good about what we are doing daily.</description>

      <description>Last Christmas (2020) my wife gave me a nice sketchbook. I was excited by it. I could imagine it filled with all kinds of interesting sketches, some watercolor ideas, and generally filled with cool art.
Here I am in late September 2021, and well, the sketchbook&amp;rsquo;s pages have remained free of pencil marks, watercolors, or ideas from yours truly.
Admittedly this year I have not cranked out as many new pieces of art as in the past few years.</description>

      <description>Recently, I shared this tune with a friend of mine in New Orleans. He told me it was a perfect song for the times.
Perhaps Tomorrow is a song I might give to my younger self given the chance. Life can be hard and doesnâ€™t pull punches. One makes mistakes, but tomorrow is a new day! Itâ€™s a chance to heal, to move on, to go a new direction.</description>

      <title>Midiman driver for Mac OS Catalina and Big Sur</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little Midiman 1x1 Sport that I love using. It uses phantom power and is small enough to haul around if needed. I have other gear that I can use to replace it, but I wanted to keep using this device.
The Midiman 1x1 Sport does NOT work with Mac OS Catalina, or Big Sur without a 64 bit driver update. There is NO updated driver from the manufacturer.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d like to be slowing down much of the time so that I could enjoy the little things in life. Like so many of us, I find myself pulled in a number of directions trying to keep it all moving in the right direction. I&amp;rsquo;d like to practice what I preach, but in honesty, the only slowing down I might do today would be to share this track!
This is a simple instrumental with a little vocal harmony near the end; I recorded it at home using Logic Pro X, a Focusrite 18i8, a tele custom, and a Shure SM58; I hope you like it.</description>

      <description>Last year when Covid hit and most of us found ourselves working at home, my wife, a school teacher, and I started a garden. It became one of the things that we both found ourselves looking forward to daily. Now a year later, we have begun our planning for this year&amp;rsquo;s garden!
The excitement and anticipation of the Cater Garden 2021, is upon us! We look forward to Spring and the days ahead!</description>

      <description>Last year I wrote a little poem from the perspective of my youngest grandson. My family and some friends fell in love with the story.
I started sketching and watercoloring the illustrations for it. After working through a number of the illustrations, I shared electronic copies of the work with a few folks. The illustrations were well received, but I wanted to do a little better. The holidays came, and I got busy with my day job, so I put the illustration work on hold.</description>
