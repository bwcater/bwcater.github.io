This morning my youngest daughter and I got up early and did a little fishing. 
Short story is that she caught three perch and I caught zero. It was great to be out there enjoying 
the morning, the outdoors, and time with her.

After we got home, I got a shower, a cup of coffee, and booted up the Mac. I sat down and got started 
right where I last left off on what I am thinking is my next children's book. 

The first pass writing comes. Some pruning and clean up happens along the way. The concept illustrations 
are started and worked / reworked until they fit what images are in my head. Honing and sharpening the text 
will come again and again until it is the crisp concise idea that conveys the story as envisioned. 

As the book comes together I sync into a child like mode wanting to share my new creation with those around me. 
Though not ready for public consumption, I usually share it with my family, some friends, and a few others 
who will offer their critique.
