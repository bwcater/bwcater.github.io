      <description>A few years ago I stumbled across a cool game engine named PixiJS! I downloaded it and created a satirical version of the old Atari game, Kaboom! In my version the &amp;ldquo;bomber&amp;rdquo; was a cartooned version of the CIO of the company I was working for at the time. He was dropping coins from the top that were being caught by the arms of employees. It was made to just to poke fun.</description>

      <description>Sitting here in my easy chair looking over the new Hugo based site, I was thinking about adding a page, or section, to show some of my photography. Over the years I have photographed brides &amp;amp; grooms, family portraits, product lines for companies, music recording sessions at Nashville studios for music artists, farm landscapes, and many other subjects!

      <description>Today as I added some art to the site, I realized that in 2016 I posted more art per month. I was surprised to see in the years that followed I posted less. While I have posted less in the last few years since, I&amp;rsquo;ve not given up the desire, nor the pencil, or brush!
When I walk the dog, or work in the garden, I stare at the trees, the land, the sky.</description>

      <description>While working to flesh out the content for the new site, I find myself hanging on little details. I really don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy writing and talking about myself. I find that I go into editorial mode and overwork the details of &amp;lsquo;what to keep / what to delete&amp;rsquo;.
There are so many little things I could tell you about myself. The little marketing voices start kicking in and they drown out the earthy realism of what could be captured and shared.</description>
