    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Working with technology in my day job, I enjoy reading various sources and learning what others are doing with technologies they use in their day jobs and lives. Two sites that I frequent are <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://slashdot.org">Slashdot.org</a>.</p>
<p>On Hacker News I have noticed links about a technology called <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a>. Candidly, I skipped over them because there are so many technologies available these days, and only so many hours a day! I am not one easily mesmerized by shiny new tech. I tend to be more pragmatic.</p>
<p>(For those of you interested, in my day job, my toolset consist of C#, .Net Core, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, Angular, and Azure DevOps. In years past I have worked in languages like C, C++, and even Visual Basic. ðŸ˜€)</p>
<p>When a coworker announced he was leaving to pursue an opportunity that excited him, I was naturally curious as to what tech stack the new employer was focusing their energy on?  His reply, &ldquo;Elixir&rdquo;. Curiosity killed the cat. I went back to the Hacker News page and searched for Elixir. I believed that folks' comments there would more than likely yield a good cross section of real world experiences. Many times in the comments people share tidbits that helped them.</p>
<p>As I perused comments I was a little more interested. I went to the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir language home page</a> and read more there. The selling points: scalability, low-latency, fault tolerance, and concurrency stood out to me.</p>
<p>Built on top of the Erlang tried and true virtual machine created in the late 1990s, called <a href="http://www.cs-lab.org/historical_beam_instruction_set.html">BEAM</a>, Elixir brings something new with something old. From the testimonials scattered across my search results, for many it appears to be a <em>perfect marriage</em>.</p>
<p>Elixir is a functional language. From what I am reading, Elixir doesn&rsquo;t have loops. Loop like functionality can be implemented using recursion.</p>
<p>I have spent the majority of my developer life using object oriented tools, but of late I have been hearing more about functional programming techniques from coworkers.  Learning more about functional programming also piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Intrigued, and wanting to try and understand a little more about the world to which my friend was going, I installed Elixir on my Mac. I found a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JakeBecker.elixir-ls">VS Code extension</a> and I started tinkering. That&rsquo;s where I am now. It&rsquo;s a different world than the one with which I am accustomed. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing!</p>
<p>There is a lot of detail about Elixir that I missed in such a small post. Having really only begun on my own journey into the Elixir world, I hope, if you are reading this and you are a deep understander of the Elixir ecosystem, that you will not take offense to my light write-up, but will see this as the writing of one who sees great value in getting to know and understand Elixir!</p>
<p>I would encourage you to watch the following video that gives the Elixir story in the words of its creator &ndash; JosÃ© Valim.  Enjoy!!!</p>
