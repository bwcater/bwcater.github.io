			"The page you are presently viewing uses <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> to power the static blog like system.  A couple of years back, I was introduced to Vue while working for a Nashville based consulting firm. I went on to work heavily in Angular, but always looked back fondly at Vue. Today I am back working again with Vue.",
			"I have tinkered with some of the more popular static site engines like Jekyll and Hugo.  They offer some great features and power. I am also aware of VuePress. While what I have put together here is not as feature rich, it meets what I wanted and needed.",
			"The plan is to use this section, Reflections, to share my songs, art, and thoughts. I hope you will find useful stuff that will make you want to come along for the journey.",
			"<br/><b>Special Note:</b> More recent posts will be shown from top to bottom; also you can click the title to view the specific reflection in its own page."
