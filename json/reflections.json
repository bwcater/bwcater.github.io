The illustrations were well received, but I wanted to do a little better. The holidays came, and I got busy with my day job, so I put the illustration work on hold.",

			"The page you are presently viewing uses <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Vue</a> to power the static blog like system.  A couple of years back, I was introduced to Vue while working for a Nashville based consulting firm. I went on to work heavily in Angular, but always looked back fondly at Vue. Today I am back working again with Vue.",
