Recently, I shared this tune with a friend of mine in New Orleans. He told me it was a perfect song for the times.

Perhaps Tomorrow is a song I might give to my younger self given the chance. Life can be hard and doesn’t pull punches. One makes mistakes, but tomorrow is a new day! It’s a chance to heal, to move on, to go a new direction. In these crazy times some cast hope aside. The underlying theme: don’t lose hope. Tomorrow is around the bend…
