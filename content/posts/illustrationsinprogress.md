Last year I wrote a little poem from the perspective of my youngest grandson. My family and some friends fell in love with the story.

I started sketching and watercoloring the illustrations for it. After working through a number of the illustrations, I shared electronic copies of the work with a few folks. The illustrations were well received, but I wanted to do a little better. The holidays came, and I got busy with my day job, so I put the illustration work on hold.

I am hoping to get the illustrations completed in the early part of the first quarter of 2021! I am excited about this project and I look forward to sharing it.

All the best to you this year!!!
