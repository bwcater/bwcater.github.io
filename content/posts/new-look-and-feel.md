I am in a mode of trying to simplify my life. One such way of doing that is going back to using 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for my website. The elegance of using Markdown syntax coupled with the ability to quickly
grasp the structure of Hugo and the Go Language syntax makes it a clear winner in my opinion. Mix in the available themes offered and it is a home run!

I hope you find the website easier to navigate and to find what you want! I cannot take any credit on this work or this site other then possibly being smart enough to choose a great platform! ðŸ˜€
