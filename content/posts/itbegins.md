Last year when Covid hit and most of us found ourselves working at home, my wife, a school teacher, and I started a garden. It became one of the things that we both found ourselves looking forward to daily. Now a year later, we have begun our planning for this year's garden!

The excitement and anticipation of the Cater Garden 2021, is upon us! We look forward to Spring and the days ahead!

Below is a just one of many Sunflowers from last years garden!
