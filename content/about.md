I am Billy Wayne Cater. My friends call me Wayne! 

![Wayne alt >](/images/waynecater.jpg)

I am a songwriter, but isn’t everyone in Nashville? I play guitar and tinker with other instruments -- piano / keyboard, and bass guitar. I am an [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com) member. You can find some of my music work on Apple Music, Amazon Music, Spotify, and others. 

I've got a day job too! I’ve been a software developer for 25 years. The technologies I use these days are C#.Net, SQL Server, ASP .Net Core (API), and Angular. 

Around 2013, I started sketching and drawing caricatures of coworkers. One thing leads to another and I found that I enjoyed sketching landscapes, and painting watercolors. Checkout some of my art on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bwcater/). 

In April 2021, my first children's book was published -- _Looking For Friends In My Backyard_. I wrote and illustrated it for my grandsons, but I am happy to share it with you and your little ones. You can purchase it on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Millon, and Walmart.
