      <description>Last year when Covid hit and most of us found ourselves working at home, my wife, a school teacher, and I started a garden. It became one of the things that we both found ourselves looking forward to daily. Now a year later, we have begun our planning for this year&amp;rsquo;s garden!
The excitement and anticipation of the Cater Garden 2021, is upon us! We look forward to Spring and the days ahead!</description>
