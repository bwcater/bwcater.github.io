      <description>I am excited to share that I have a new children&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ndash; Looking For Friends In My Backyard.
Looking For Friends In My Backyard is about a day in the life of a little boy exploring his backyard! The illustrations are watercolor pieces that I did myself.

You can order your copy today on Amazon.com!

      <description>Last year I wrote a little poem from the perspective of my youngest grandson. My family and some friends fell in love with the story.
I started sketching and watercoloring the illustrations for it. After working through a number of the illustrations, I shared electronic copies of the work with a few folks. The illustrations were well received, but I wanted to do a little better. The holidays came, and I got busy with my day job, so I put the illustration work on hold.</description>
